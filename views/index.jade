    h1 Real-time Waiting List Demonstration

    p To test it out, create a room by going to [this url]/[room name] or go to the 
      a(href="/demo") default room
      | . Gather up as many friends / devices / browsers as you can to hit the same URL. The server uses
      | cookies to differentiate users, so tabs within the same browser won't count as separate users. 
      | The first  few sessions (the exact number depends on the MAXIMUM_ROOM_SIZE setting in server.js) 
      | to connect will see a collaborative drawing experience. Subsequent sessions will land on the waiting 
      | list. Disconnecting the earlier sessions (by closing the window or moving to a different page) will
      | change the status for the sessions in the waiting list after about 30 seconds. The session at
      | the front of the list will automatically enter the room.
